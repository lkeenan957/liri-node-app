LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

There are 3 options you can do: 
 - to get tweets on a topic, you type "my-tweets topic"
 - to get few details of your favourite movie from OMDB, you type "movie-this starwars"
 - to spotify a song, you type "spotify-this-song Titanium". Titanium = can be an ysong 


Example: to run this in the terminal: 
```
$ node liri.js my-tweets country
```
